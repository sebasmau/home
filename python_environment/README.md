# Python environment
To do datascience, you'll need Python & several packages. These packages need to be installed on your machine. 

To prevent compatibility issues, an miniconda environment can be used: all dependencies are installed within a Python environment & this environment can be moved from machine to machine.

When Brecht is programming a notebook & he wants to run it on the machine of Sébastien, Sébastien just need to install the same environment Brecht was using. As Invencado, there is a general Invencado environment available. If there are packages missing, just update the environment.yml file and **do not use pip**. That way, everyone can run all the notebooks. 

If you want to deviate, please provide a seperate environement.yml file for your notebook or application.
